# AI-based-advertise-recommendation-system-using-EEG-device

Requirements:
Devices: EEG device - emotiv insight 5
Software: Microsoft excel, Emotiv-Pro, EEG lab

Process:

1.	Create three unique advertisement' videos.
2.	Develop a Google Form for participant feedback.
3.	Participants wear EEG headsets during ad viewing.
4.	Use Emotiv Pro to capture brainwave frequencies.
5.	Send Google Form to person for feedback on liked ads.
6.	Like this collect EEG data from 50 students in Excel.
7.	Download the .csv and .edf files from Emotiv pro software.
8.	You will get 3 .csv files(ie. one for each advertise) for each students.
    Calculate mean of the csv file .
  	Then create a single fime of all the advertises mean. (file provided ie. 50 readings).
10.	Conduct ANOVA test for brainwave frequency differences.
11.	Apply machine learning (Random Forest, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree) on CSV.
12.	Achieve highest accuracy (ie. here 79%) with Random Forest.
13.	Use EEG Lab software, provide EDF file for individual student.
14.	Check if recommendation aligns with student's feedback.
15.	Present graphical representation for interpretation.
16.	Successfully create AI-based ad recommendation system.
